conference on geometric and combinatorial methods in group theory and
semigroup theory.">

<h3>
May 15 to May 19, 2000
</h3>

</center>

The main topics to be discussed at this conference will be
asymptotic properties and algorithmic problems for groups and
semigroups. In particular, the talks will cover the
following general areas of group theory and semigroup theory:
boundaries of groups, infinite words, dynamical
properties of groups and semigroups, quasi-isometries of groups,
profinite methods in semigroups, rewriting systems for
groups and semigroups, and algorithmic and computational
problems in groups and semigroups.

<p>The conference is organized under the auspices of the Discrete,
Experimental, and Applied Mathematics program at the University of
Nebraska-Lincoln.

<h3>Transportation to Lincoln</h3>
<ul>To fly into the airport in
Lincoln, Nebraska, flights are
available from TWA (via St. Louis), United (via Chicago or Denver), Northwest
(via Minneapolis on Northwest Airlink), or U.S. Air Express (via Kansas City).
The taxi ride from the airport to downtown is approximately $14. There are also
many flights available in and out of Omaha, which is about an hour's drive
from Lincoln. Occasionally you can find flights into Omaha which are
significantly less expensive than flights into Lincoln. If you arrive or leave
from Omaha, you will either need to rent a car, or use the shuttle service
between the Omaha airport and Lincoln. This service, called the Eppley
Express, has three connections each direction every weekday, and fewer on
weekends. For details about the shuttle go to the web site <a 
href="http://www.eppleyexpress.com"> http://www.eppleyexpress.com</a>.
<br>
If you are driving, Lincoln is
right off of Interstate 80. Here is a
<a 
href="http://www.math.unl.edu/~dpitts/map.html"> map </a>
of the area near the Math/Stat
Department, and links to MAPBLAST (for maps of other areas and driving
directions.)

<H3>Getting around Lincoln</H3>
<ul>
<li>    <a href=map.jpg>City Campus Map.</A>
<li>    <A HREF="http://www.unl.edu/pr/unlmaps/stdmaps/html/unlmaps.htm">
        Downtown Lincoln and the University.</a>
<br>    You can click on city campus to get an picture of the city campus.
<br>    Downtown is laid out in a grid, with
        numbered streets going north-south and lettered streets going
        east-west.
    To get from downtown to campus by foot, walk to 12th and R on the grid,
then continue walking north (12th St. will be pointed due south) until
you get to Oldfather Hall.
<li> If you are driving into Lincoln, you will most likely be coming in from 
I-80. It will be easiest to take the Downtown Lincoln exit, which gets you 
onto I-180. I-180 becomes 9th street, and at this point you will be
on the grid. If you stay in a hotel, you should be able to find
the hotel address on the map listed above.

<h3>Weather</h3>
<ul>
The weather in Lincoln in May can be quite variable.  
Most likely it will be very
pleasant (high temperatures about 70 degrees (F), lows about 40-50 F), but
the standard deviation is high, so be prepared for a variety of interesting
weather conditions. The conference organizers take no responsibility for the
weather.
