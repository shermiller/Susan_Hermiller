Between 1963 and 1976, and resuming in 1988, the Department of Mathematical 
Sciences at New Mexico State University has held a series of annual symposia 
during the winter recess.  In 1997 the series continued with
<p>

<center>  EDWARD GREEN and DEREK HOLT </center>
<p>
speaking on
<p>

<center> REWRITING TECHNIQUES  AND  NONCOMMUTATIVE GROEBNER BASES </center>
<p>

<center> January 3-7, 1997 </center> <p>

The titles and abstracts of all of the talks presented
at the Symposium are available 
<a href="titlabs2.pdf">here</a>.<p>


Complete lectures notes for all ten of the main lectures
notes can be downloaded from this web page:
<a href="green2.ps.gz">Edward Green's </a>
lectures and <a href="holt2.ps.gz">Derek Holt's </a> lectures
may be viewed from these links. <p>


We also collected electronic versions of some of the papers
presented at the conference to make them readily accessible
on this web page.

<ul>
<li> D. Cohen, <a href="cohen.ps.gz">String rewriting and homology of monoids</a>
<li> W. Helton and M. Stankus, Computer assistance in discovering
formulas and theorems in system engineering
(plus other papers) in <a href="http://math.ucsd.edu/~helton">
Helton's home page</a>. 
<li> S. Hermiller and M. Shapiro, <a href="shms.ps.gz">Rewriting systems and geometric
3-manifolds</a>
<li> B. Keller, Alternatives in
implementing noncommutative
Groebner basis systems (along with more information, in
<a href="http://hal.cs.vt.edu/~keller/">
Keller's home page</a>).
<li> E. Lo, <a href="lo.ps.gz">A polycyclic quotient algorithm</a>.
<li> G. Ostheimer, <a href="ostheimer.ps.gz">Algorithms for polycyclic by finite groups</a>
<li> J. Wavrik, <a href="wavrik.ps.gz">Rewrite rules and simplification of matrix expressions</a>
</ul>
<p>
The <a href="naminst.txt">participant list</a> and 
<a href="sched2.txt">schedule</a> are also included here.
If you want a copy of the original conference announcement
(perhaps to blackmail us for our claims about the mild weather?!),
is is available <a href="annc.pdf">here</a>.
