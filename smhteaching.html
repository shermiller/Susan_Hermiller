  </ul>
 </ul>

<p>

<li> Course development:
 <ul>
 <li> Math 350 Modern Geometry:  
  Complete course redesign to align material with
  the National/Nebraska teaching standards for the
  associated high school geometry topics.  The 
  emphasis was changed to showing the students why - and when - the
  standard results of high school geometry are true, 
  and incorporated significant component working with software such as
  Geometer's Sketchpad for hands-on exploration of  
  Euclidean and hyperbolic geometry.

 <li>  Math 471 Undergraduate Topology: 
  New course designed 
  to be accessible to students with a variety 
  of abilities and backgrounds.
  The material covered includes some basics of point-set
  topology, but also combinatorial and geometric aspects
  of topology that allow the students to use pictures and
  other ``concrete'' methods to study spaces.

 <li>  Math 911 Topics in Group Theory:  
  Several different courses have been developed under this title, with 
  half or full semester modules in areas including:  Growth of
  groups, poly-properties of groups, geometric group theory,
  and homology of groups.
