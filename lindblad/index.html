<p>Welcome to my web page.  You will find information about my Ph.D. here.

<p>The program <em>spar</em> determines whether or not a word
u equals 1 in an inverse monoid of the form M=Inv&lt;X|w=1&gt;, where
the relator w is a sparse word.  The source code is available in 
<a href="sparsrc.tar.gz">sparsrc.tar.gz</a>.  To use the
program, unpack the file (e.g., "tar xzf sparsrc.tar.gz"), change to
the sparsrc directory ("cd sparsrc"), and
compile <em>spar</em> by typing "make".  To run the program,
type "spar" or "./spar".
You can also try downloading and running the
GNU/Linux executable (<a href="spar">spar</a>) directly, but you may
need to compile it yourself to make it work on your machine.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
We study a class of inverse monoids of the form M=Inv&lt;X|w=1&gt;,
where the single relator w has a combinatorial property that we call
<strong>sparse</strong>.  
For a sparse word w, we prove that the Schutzenberger complex
of the identity of M has a particularly nice topology.  We analyze
the manner in which the Schutzenberger complex is constructed using an
iterative procedure, due to Stephen, analogous to the Todd-Coxeter
procedure.  We define an appropriate notion of dual graph of the Schutzenberger
complex, and prove that this dual graph is a tree if w is sparse.
We use this tree to construct a pushdown automaton that encodes the
information contained in the Schutzenberger complex.  This pushdown automaton
provides us with an algorithm that, given a word u,
determines whether or not u=1 in M.  This, together with results
of Stephen and the fact due to Ivanov, Margolis, and Meakin that the
inverse monoid is E-unitary, shows that the word problem is solvable
for M.  Finally, we provide an implementation, in the C++
programming language, of the algorithm to determine whether or not
u=1 in M.
