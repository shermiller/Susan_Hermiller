<ul>
<li> <b> What? </b>
<ul>
<li> Internships can apply <b>all</b> areas of mathematics.
Internships are problem-solving applications of any/all
areas of mathematics, not just in what has
traditionally been called "applied
mathematics".
<li> Many also involve software implementation 
of mathematical solutions to problems.
<li> Internships are often full time work during part or
all of the summer.
</ul>

<li> <b>Why?</b>
<ul>
<li>  For those interested in considering a nonacademic
career after completing your degree, an internship can be
an important part of your resum&eacute; for your job search.
<li> For those interested in considering an academic career,
an internship can be valuable experience for advising your
own students.
<li> An internship at an institution may lead to a job offer
from the same business/lab when you get your degree.

</ul>

<li> <b>When?</b>
<ul>
<li> Most internships have application deadlines in
December-February.  (A few of them are earlier.) 
<li> For some internships you may need to organize
letters of recommendation or transcripts, which can be 
difficult to do in late December/early January, so it's
a good idea to start working on an application sooner.
</ul>

<li> <b>How?</b>
<ul>
<li> Surf the web for information and application sites.
<li> Make contacts through your advisor and other networking.
<li> Resum&eacute;: (National labs) Academic CV, but highlight skills:
programming and scientific computing experience and 
languages/software packages, advanced math courses,
any publications, prior work.
