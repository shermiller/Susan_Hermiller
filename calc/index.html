<center><h2>LEARNING CALCULUS</h2></center><p>

<center>Prepared by: Susan Hermiller, Melanie Martin, Eric York</center><p>

Welcome to the wonderful world of Calculus. In order to help you
get the most out of Calculus, we have prepared the following to help you
make better use of your study time and to make you aware of some of the
resources available for help, if you need it.<p>

<b>Some Initial Pointers:</b><p>

Calculus is likely to require that you make a substantial investment
of <b>TIME</b>. Probably a minimum of three hours outside class for every
hour you spend in class. Build this into your life. You should work on it
some everyday, whether you have class or not and whether anything is due or
not. One of the advantages of mathematics is that it can be done virtually
anywhere, anytime. You can use time when you are in the shower or waiting in
line to be thinking about problems or going over new concepts in class.<p>

One of the best ways to learn anything is to explain it to someone
else. Working in groups is a good way to provide yourself with this
opportunity. You can also amaze your friends with careful explanations of,
say, all of the different interpretations of the concept of a derivative.<p>

Math is not a spectator sport. You will need to actively participate,
roll up your sleeves and get that pencil moving. You will also need to move
your brain. Expect to have to think about concepts and problems. Some of the
problems you will encounter will teach you new techniques: like playing
scales in a musical instrument, or running laps around a track. You might
not see the point immediately, but they are strengthening you so everything
will come together when it counts. Think of them as push-ups for the brain
and practice them often. Some problems will require you to think hard and
pull concepts together (at this point you will be glad you did your
push-ups). Take some time with them, talk about them, take breaks if you are
getting frustrated, ask for help if you are stuck, enjoy the process: you
are learning.<p>

If you have recently come from high school, even if you have had
Calculus in high school, expect this to be different. There are likely to be
more, better prepared students here than in your high school, but remember
that you are trying to learn Calculus and not competing with other students.
Expect to have to do more work and for the course to move at a faster pace.<p>

If you have recently come from the Math Learning Center, this course
will require a greater degree of maturity and self-initiative. Thinking and
understanding concepts will be emphasized here.<p>

Many problems which require Calculus cannot be solved with simple
application of a ``formula''. To paraphrase Albert Einstein, ``The only
thing you absolutely must know is the location of the library.'' In your
situation this means you will probably always be able to find the formula
you need somewhere. However, you will need to be able to set up your
problems so that you know exactly what it is that you need! Since you will
probably take about six more courses (depending upon your major) which
utilize the concepts from this course, it will be especially important to
understand what is useful or applicable in a particular context. This is why
understanding the process for solving a particular type of problem is
emphasized over memorizing formulas. In most cases, if you understand the
concepts, memorizing a formula becomes completely unnecessary because you
construct the necessary tools when needed.<p>

<b>Now for some Concrete Pointers:</b><p>

<b>A.</b> Classes are held for your benefit. If attending class wasn't
important, all college courses would be by correspondence, and your tuition
would be much lower! During class your instructor will go over examples,
which are important, and most likely not in the book. It often helps to have
a new concept explained in several different ways; the book and the lecture
are two different ways which are readily available. Information about
quizzes, exams, and due dates is often given out in class. This will help
you pace your studying. Calculus courses are sequential, so the stuff you
see in 191, for example, will enable you to make sense of a lot of the stuff
you will see in 192. As one instructor was heard to say, ``Everything you
have learned since you were three can be used in this class.'' Hence you
will not be helping yourself if you ``cram'' right before an exam and forget
the material immediately afterward. As instructors, we note a definite
correlation between grades and class attendance. (Come to office hours if
you do not understand this last sentence.) What's the point? <b>GO TO
CLASS!!</b><p>

<b>B.</b> The plethora of information to be found in your textbook is
astounding. One might even say it covers nearly everything you need to learn
in Calculus in one form or another. However, math books are not meant to be
read like novels (even though they are often exciting and dramatic). It is
generally best to read the sections of the book to be covered in lecture
through quickly to get some idea of what is there before going to lecture.
After the lecture read through it carefully, with pencil and paper in hand,
working through examples in detail and taking notes. Make a list of
questions to ask in office hours or at the next lecture. One thing to bear
in mind while reading your text is that the result of an example is often
secondary to the process used in obtaining the result. This is one reason
you should be sure you understand all the details the author left out (most
likely intentionally). Also, many techniques for solving problems are
displayed elsewhere than in examples, so read \textit{all} of the
appropriate section. Even though it sometimes may not seem to be the case,
the text does give the tools to do the homework problems.<p>

<b>C.</b> Just as you must play a lot of basketball (or Tetris) to be
good at it, you must <b>DO</b> a lot of Calculus in order to be
successful. At minimum, work every problem your instructor suggests. If you
are having trouble or want more practice, work other problems in that
section or get another book and work problems out of it. Most texts also
have ``additional'' or review problems at the end of each chapter. These may
or may not be arranged by section. If you are having trouble getting a
correct answer to a problem, think about what is going wrong, that way you
can learn something new and prevent yourself from making the same error in
the future. Don't settle for a correct answer that you don't understand.<p>

<li>Work problems more than once: a good way to start off a study
session is to start by working some problems from the last few assignments.
Work problems until you can do them quickly and they become your friends.
You can even name the most difficult ones. When reviewing or re-doing a
problem, thing about <i>why</i> you take the steps you do, rather than
simply repeating the problem in a robot-like fashion. Remember, the process
is usually more important than the result.<p>

<li>The fastest way to get into trouble in Calculus is to not do the
homework. Remember, similar problems will probably show up on quizzes and
exams, where you will be expected to work them quickly and accurately,
probably without the book in front of you. Also remember that you will get
more out of your homework time if you minimize distractions, i.e., turn the
TV or stereo off.<p>

<b>D.</b> Contrary to many students' opinions, your instructor wants you
to succeed. Extremely rare is the instructor who will intentionally put
completely different material on an exam that what was covered in class. For
this reason, pay attention to your instructor and take notes. Then <b>READ</b> your notes and be sure you understand them, filling in any missing
details. Use your notes as well as the text when doing homework. Review your
notes regularly and pay attention to the comments your instructor writes on
your work. Read carefully all supplemental material provided by your
instructor. Remember that if your instructor thinks an example is important
enough to do in class, or takes the time to prepare a handout, it may also
be of sufficient importance to test you on it.<p>

<b> E.</b> Quizzes and exams can be the bane of your existence, or they
can be showcases of your mastery of the material. When studying for them,
work every homework problem assigned in the sections to be covered (more
than once!), paying special attention to why you take the steps you do, and
why it works. Review and work through examples in your notes and the text,
again with particular emphasis on the process being used. Each section of
your text has a central idea or concept. In many cases, this central idea
depends in some way on an elementary concept with which you are already
familiar. For example, finding volumes of some solids is simply an extension
of finding areas of some geometric shapes that you already know. If you are
able to explain exactly what the ``nugget'' of a section is and on what
basic ``stuff'' it depends, chances are you are well on your way to a good
understanding of the material at hand.<p>

<center><h3>GETTING HELP:</h3></center>

Working in groups can be of enormous help in understanding Calculus
concepts. One of the best ways to gain understanding yourself is to attempt
to explain it to others. Also, many times one student will ``see'' one
problem, while another will ``see'' a different problem. In this way, people
working together can benefit from having access to several different
viewpoints. Form study groups with your classmates. The classrooms in
Science Hall in which Calculus is taught are reserved for the use of
Calculus students from 4:00 PM to 9:00 PM nightly. So there is nearly always
a convenient place to gather.<p>

Every instructor has office hours during which you can seek the help
you need. Make use of them. You can gain valuable insight into difficult
material as well as the material your instructor considers the most
important. Frequently instructors suffer from depression as a result of the
lack of students during office hours, so consider it your humanitarian duty
to go see your instructor during these times. It might even help you! If you
have a time conflict with your instructor's hours, ask to make appointments.
Your instructor will nearly always be glad to oblige.<p>

During the semester Walden Hall 99 (near the soda and candy machines)
has graduate students scheduled to help math students, especially in
Calculus. Schedules are posted on the doors to Walden Hall and in WH 99
which reveal when help is available. Try going at different times to find
the people with whom you have the best rapport.<p>

Study guides and solutions manuals can be helpful. However, be warned
that they can also be a trap, for they are no substitute for working
problems out for yourself. Use sparingly and as a last resort, after truly
attempting to solve a problem yourself.<p>

The Center for Learning Assistance, located in Hardman Hall 210,
phone 646-3136, offers a variety of courses and workshops in general study
skills. Some of the things they can help you with are: time management,
memory, test taking and preparation, overcoming math anxiety, math/science
study skills. They also have a drop-in service. So if your study skills are
a little rusty, or you've never had the opportunity to develop them, this
might be the ticket from just getting by to real success.<p>

Student Support Services is located in Room 143, Garcia Annex; their
phone number is 646-1336. They provide free mentoring, tutoring, and various
other services to students in the following categories:<br>

<ul><li>Freshmen and
Sophomores whose parents did not graduate from college and/or who meet low
income guidelines

<li>Undergraduate students with disabilities.</ul>

If you fall
into either of these categories, this is something to consider seriously.<p>

Campus Tutoring Services is located in Room 143, Garcia Annex; their
phone number is 646-4236. They provide low cost tutoring (4 hours for
$10.00) for undergraduates in a wide range of subjects, including Calculus.
Their tutors are trained in how to tutor effectively and work under a
supervisor.<p>

The Department of Mathematics office and the Mathematics Learning
Center both keep lists of people who are available for private tutoring.
These people are usually advanced undergraduates or graduate students. The
math office phone number is 646-3901, and the MLC can be reached at
646-6272. In addition, you may occasionally see advertisements in the school
paper or on bulletin boards in Walden Hall or Science Hall. Prices may vary,
some restrictions may apply, offer void where prohibited.<p>
